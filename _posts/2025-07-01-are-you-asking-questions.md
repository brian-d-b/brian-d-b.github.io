Are you asking enough questions? Are you spending more time reflecting, and weaving ideas together than most? I feel bad for the people who aren't in the top 10% of this skill. Because people aren't asking enough questions. Most people are answering questions they didn't even ask themselves, which is sad.

I'm spending hours a day reflecting and asking questions about things most wouldn't consider.
